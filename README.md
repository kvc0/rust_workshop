Welcome to the Rust workshop!

If you don't want to write a sieve cache, you can skip ahead and use the `example_sieve_cache` to build upon.

**Modules:**
1. [Intro to Rust](./intro/README.md): Start here if you are new to Rust
1. [Sieve Cache](./sieve_cache/README.md): Learn applied rust by writing a modern cache eviction algorithm
1. [Benchmarking](./benchmarking/README.md): Learn tools and techniques for measuring performance of Rust code
